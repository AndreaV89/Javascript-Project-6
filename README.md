# Javascript Project 6
 Static Node.js and Express Site

 This is a portfolio site to showcase the great projects I've built. It will demonstrate that I am comfortable with using Node.js, Express and Pug. This project is all about setting up a server, handling requests and working with server-side JavaScript.

 Style changes:
 
 - Changed background of sidebar;
 - Changed font (Roboto Condensed);
 - Changed buttons color, and added a hover shadow;
